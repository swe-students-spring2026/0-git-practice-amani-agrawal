## Reflection
This article highlights how software quality often shows up in early signals, not deep logic dives. The author checks a new codebase's structure, naming, and organization first. This really resonates with me: good software isn't just correct; it's clear and maintainable.

What stood out most is the emphasis on developer experience and cognitive load. A well-organized codebase with clear instructions makes onboarding new developers way easier. The article reinforces that investing time in clean structure and thoughtful design early on pays off in collaborative projects.

Ultimately, I find this article valuable because it pushes engineers to think beyond features and focus on writing approachable, readable, and sustainable code.

## Response from Chase Vitale

The personal experience that Habibi shared in his article of dealing with lacking READMEs was extremely relatable to me. I found it interesting that even individuals with years of software development experience make some of the same mistakes as beginner programmers. In some projects I have contributed to, it was difficult to gain footing because of lacking documentation. This article seems extremely valuable since it teaches programmers of all skill levels how important documentation is.
