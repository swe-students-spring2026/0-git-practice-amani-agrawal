[The First Thing I Check in Every Codebase](https://medium.com/@saeedhbi/the-first-thing-i-check-in-every-codebase-1c7c61d3bcd1) — Saeed H. Behbahani


This article is interesting because it highlights how software quality is often revealed by small, early signals, rather than deep dives into complex logic. The author explains that the first thing they check in a new codebase is how easy it is to understand its structure, naming conventions, and overall organization. This resonates with the idea that good software is not just about correctness, but also about clarity and maintainability.

What stood out to me is the emphasis on developer experience and cognitive load. A well-organized codebase with clear entry points and consistent patterns makes it significantly easier for new developers to onboard and contribute effectively. The article reinforces the idea that investing time in clean structure and thoughtful design early on pays long-term dividends, especially in collaborative and evolving projects.

Overall, I find this article valuable because it encourages engineers to think beyond features and focus on writing code that is approachable, readable, and sustainable over time.
