## Reflection

This article highlights how software quality often shows up in early signals, not deep logic dives. The author checks a new codebase's structure, naming, and organization first. This really resonates with me: good software isn't just correct; it's clear and maintainable.

What stood out most is the emphasis on developer experience and cognitive load. A well-organized codebase with clear instructions makes onboarding new developers way easier. The article reinforces that investing time in clean structure and thoughtful design early on pays off in collaborative projects.

Ultimately, I find this article valuable because it pushes engineers to think beyond features and focus on writing approachable, readable, and sustainable code.
